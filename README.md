# Scientific Calculator (Tkinter)

A simple scientific calculator built using Python's `tkinter` library. This calculator supports basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, logarithms, exponentiation, and factorials. It also includes memory storage functions and an angle mode toggle between degrees and radians.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
- **Scientific Functions**: 
  - Trigonometric (sin, cos, tan) with Degree/Radian mode.
  - Logarithmic (log, ln).
  - Power functions (`x^y`, `sqrt`).
  - Factorial (`n!`).
  - Reciprocal (`1/x`).
- **Memory Functions**: `MC`, `MR`, `M+`, `M-`, `MS`.
- **Error Handling**: Prevents invalid mathematical operations.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Intuitive button layout with a display screen.

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).
